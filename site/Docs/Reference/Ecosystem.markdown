# An Overview of the NuGet Ecosystem
First introduced in 2010, NuGet has been around for a few years now and many people and organizations are starting to realize that NuGet presents a great opportunity to improve and automate parts of the development processes. Whether you work on open source projects or in an enterprise environment, NuGet is here to stay, but you have a way bigger NuGet ecosystem at your disposal today.

Because the NuGet project is open source under a permissive [Apache v2 license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache/), other projects can leverage NuGet and companies can build support for it in their products. All of them extend the NuGet ecosystem to what it is today.

It is great to see how NuGet adoption is growing, especially when people come up with innovative ideas that facilitate our work even further. And if any of you has a way to improve the NuGet tools, whether the Outercurve, Microsoft or any other NuGet-based product, then please tell them about your ideas. Report defects, log feature requests, provide feedback, write documentation or submit a pull request and experience eternal gratitude from an entire community.

## Outercurve Foundation
The NuGet project provides a free, open source package management system for .NET and consists out of a few client tools (NuGet Command Line and NuGet Visual Studio Extension) and the official NuGet Gallery hosted at [http://www.nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org). Combined, these tools and the gallery form the NuGet project, governed by [Outercurve Foundation](http://www.outercurve.org/) and part of the ASP.NET Open Source Gallery.

The sources for the Outercurve NuGet clients can be found on [Codeplex](http://nuget.codeplex.com/), while the NuGet Gallery sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery).

### NuGet Core project
* License: Apache v2
* Sources: [https://nuget.codeplex.com](https://nuget.codeplex.com/)

Most NuGet client tools are based on the cross-platform `NuGet.Core` project. If you want to build your own NuGet client, your best bet is to fetch the NuGet.Core project's [sources from Codeplex](https://nuget.codeplex.com/), or to run the following command in the Package Manager Console to install the [NuGet.Core package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Nuget.Core/):

    Install-Package NuGet.Core

### NuGet Command Line tool
* License: Apache v2
* Sources: [https://nuget.codeplex.com](https://nuget.codeplex.com/)

This is a command line wrapper around NuGet.Core.

More info: [NuGet Command Line Reference](Command-Line-Reference)

### NuGet Server project
* License: Apache v2
* Sources: [https://nuget.codeplex.com](https://nuget.codeplex.com/)

To create a basic NuGet server and point it to a local folder or network share, create a new ASP.NET application and run the following command in the Package Manager Console to install the [NuGet.Server package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Server):

    Install-Package NuGet.Server

More info: [Install the NuGet.Server package](../Creating-Packages/Hosting-Your-Own-NuGet-Feeds#Step_2%3a_Install_the_NuGet.Server_Package)

Benefits:

* requires minimal infrastructure (IIS and some diskspace)
* requires .NET Framework 4.0

Drawbacks:

* non-indexed storage (slower as repository-size increases)
* single API key for entire server
* no fine-grained security
* single NuGet feed per NuGet.Server application

### Official NuGet Gallery
* License: Apache v2
* Sources: [https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery)

The official NuGet Gallery is hosted at [http://www.nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org).
Availability info: [http://status.nuget.org/](http://status.nuget.org/)
Statistics: [http://www.nuget.org/stats](http://www.nuget.org/stats)

To set up your own NuGet Gallery, fetch the sources from GitHub and follow the instructions at [https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery).

Benefits:

* indexed storage (faster querying)
* simple user system (authentication, API-key per user, manage own packages, emails)
* supports SSL

Drawbacks:

* requires proper infrastructure (IIS, SqlServer)
* requires .NET Framework 4.5 (.NET 4.5 is an in-place upgrade)
* requires you to fetch the sources, compile everything and configure quite a lot in source code and configuration files (and repeat this step if you want to upgrade to a newer version)
* there's a [NuGet Gallery Operations Toolkit](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetOperations), but it's not designed nor intended to work with every NuGetGallery installation

### NuGet Concierge
* License: Apache v2 
* Sources: https://github.com/NuGet/Concierge 

[NuGet Concierge](http://concierge.nuget.org/) is a package recommendation service: upload a packages.config file and NuGet Concierge will recommend you packages you may find useful.

## NuGet Server

[NuGet Server](http://nugetserver.net/) is a fully functional NuGet server you install as a Windows service. Purchase for $5 US, download and double click the installer. NuGet Server is basically a wrapper of the [NuGet.Server](http://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Server/) package, but installed through a wizard. NuGet Server is distributed with its own web server, so you don't need IIS.

More info: [http://nugetserver.net/](http://nugetserver.net/)

## Klondike

[Klondike](https://github.com/themotleyfool/Klondike) is a fully functional NuGet server that can be installed
as an IIS site or as a Windows Service (using OWIN self-hosting). Klondike aims to be an alternative to
[NuGet.Server](http://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Server/) that offers much faster performance by indexing
all package metadata with Lucene.Net.

Klondike is an open source alternative that's faster than NuGet.Server and easier to deploy than NuGet Gallery.

Provides:

* Windows Authentication
* API Key Authentication
* Automatic mirroring of packages from a public feed
* Symbol Package and symbol server support

More info: [https://github.com/themotleyfool/Klondike](https://github.com/themotleyfool/Klondike)

## scriptcs

Scripts can be created via a text editor and executed or code can be executed interactively in the scriptcs [REPL] (https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/REPL). scriptcs allows script authors to install NuGet packages and use them in their scripts. scriptcs also leverages NuGet for extensibility as [script packs] (https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Script-Packs) and [modules] (https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Modules) are installed as NuGet packages.

## Other NuGet-based utilities
There are quite a few other tools and utilities building further on top of NuGet. Here's a list of what I've found interesting:  

* [Glimpse Extensions](http://getglimpse.com/Packages) (plug-ins are packages)  
* [NuGetMustHaves.com](http://nugetmusthaves.com/) 
* [NuGetFeed](http://nugetfeed.org/) (build a list of favorite packages) 
* [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/) (CMS modules are fetched from a v1 NuGet feed hosted in the Orchard Gallery)  
* [Java implementation of NuGet Server](http://blog.jonnyzzz.name/2012/03/nuget-server-in-pure-java.html)
* [NuGet Fight!](http://www.nugetfight.com/)
* [NuGit](http://nugit.org/)
* [NuGetLatest](https://twitter.com/NuGetLatest) (Twitter bot tweeting new package publications)
* [HotNuget](http://hotnuget.com) (Compare package usage)
* [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/) ([Automatic](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/NugetAutomation/) TypeScript Type [Definitions published to NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=DefinitelyTyped))

## Training Materials and References
Using a new tool or technology usually comes with a learning curve. Luckily for you, NuGet has no steap learning curve it all! In fact, anyone can [get started consuming packages in no time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=PboPfoptU2c). Authoring packages however, and especially authoring good packages, as well as embracing NuGet in your automated build and deployment processes requires some research in order to get things right.
